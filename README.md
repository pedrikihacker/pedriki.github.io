Welcome to Pedriki's webpage!
My name is well, you guessed it: Pedriki Hacker. I make Modded Minecraft content.
# My ambition
When I first played Minecraft, I thought it was boring, I didn't feel it was very interesting. So I started making mods ever since then, to make the game feel more interesting and sometimes, challenging.
